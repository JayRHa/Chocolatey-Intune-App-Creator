Anyone who has worked with Intune and deployed an app knows that this is a bit of work. You have to download the sources, create the IntuneWin file, create the app in Intune. To simplify this I have created the Chocolatey Intune App Creator. With this application you can search within the >9,000 Chocolatey and automatically add this app to your Intune app portfolio with just one click.
